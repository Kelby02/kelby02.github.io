    Storytelling is one of humans defining abilities, along with our opposable thumbs, it allowed us to not only reach the top of the food chain but then exit it completely. For a long time we only communicated stories by spoken word, passed down from elders to children for thousands of years. Then as we evolved we developed scripts, pictorial languages using symbols from the real world to mark down and record a set idea, concept or thing. <br> <br> <br>
    This art of storytelling has been evolving alongside us, with our cultures, with our technology and with our social conceptions. Pushed forward by progressive art movements from the renaissance to cubism and pop music. This advancement of storytelling helps allow for different stories to be told, but more importantly, to be heard, seen, read, imagined, felt and loved. <br> <br> <br>
    When a story was passed down as an oral tradition, before the advent of writing, it would often change by a degree each time it crossed hands. slowly over time moulding into a far-shot of what it used to be. This idea of factual accounts melting as they move through time is not uncommon, I remember learning about it in primary school. However, written words also change. We change their meaning, their spelling, they fall in and out of vogue. Over time the meaning that may have once been in that ink on parchment could be lost or forever mis-reread. Even more than that, different people looking at the same ink may read different words or think about their differing contextual definitions. This mystery, this instability, this growth and evolution is at the heart of what I wish to convey. A story of how everyone sees things in a unique way, shown in a unique and ever changing structure spread across the (distorted) human form. <br> <br> <br>

                “ <br> <br> Kosuth has said that “art is making meaning,” and in his work he investigates the ways in which art-making is tied to language. <br> <br> This work is part of a series based on definitions clipped from dictionary entries for words including “art,” “chair,” “meaning,” or, in this reflexive example, “definition.” Kosuth considers the work of art to be the definition of the given word, but for the purpose of presentation he asks that his original cut-out dictionary entry be photographically enlarged to a specific dimension each time the work is exhibited. <br> <br> This Photostat is the first realisation of this work, fabricated in 1968, and as such it is shown here as a historical document. <br> <br>”
