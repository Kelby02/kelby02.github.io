        <p class="title has-text-centered"> Gareth Pugh</p>

        <p> Gareth Pugh, Central Saint Martins’ alumni, is an English fashion designer known for his distortion of the human form, often beyond recognition, and extravagant structured figures. His recent 2020 collection ‘The Reconstruction’, was no exception.
            <br> <br>
            Presented at London Fashion Week, as a visual album. A fashion collection made up of 13 still images and 13 short films. All used to encapsulate and effectively communicate the ideas and messages behind the collection. Using not only mixed media but also innovative technology and construction methods, Pugh and his team continue to push the leading edge of fashion.
            <br> <br>
            This groundbreaking artistic power is a trait Pugh and Basquiat shared. Both at the front of their fields, creating truly unique work that sent ripples through their industries, to be felt for decades.
            <br> <br>
            “It… feels reckless at the moment to work so commercially, when retail and fashion production is on its knees. Which is why all the proceeds from The Reconstruction are going to Refuge”, said Gareth in an interview with AnOther Mag in 2020. Refuge is a UK based charity that helps women and children escape from domestic violence.
