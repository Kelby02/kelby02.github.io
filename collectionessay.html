      <p class="">“Art is the elimination of the unnecessary”. - Pablo Picaso. A process of creating: Distilling work down into refined output. This essay is self diagnosis of the creative journey undertaken in the conceptualisation, research and design of a final year collection. Examining the chosen design process architecture, as defined by Fiona Dieffenbacher (2001), and the research methods used. Then breaking down the primary and secondary creative inspirations for the project and their coalescence into a final refined concept. Explore the fabric manipulations that have been researched and tested for use in the collection. Then providing a profile of the target customer and going over the critical path to production. <br> <br>
	The design process is often very personal, in its material and the practices people undertake, however Fiona Dieffenbacher’s theory of design attempts to incorporate all possible journeys by dividing them into two simple groups. The first group being ‘linear design’, where each idea in the design process is directly inspired from the one preceding it (Dieffenbacher, 2013). A series of steps, one after the other, goal driven and schedule based. Opposingly, ‘random design’ is scattered idea generation from a wider range of sources and inspirations: This more exploratory way of design is driven by intuition more so than logical planning (Dieffenbacher, 2013). A larger amount of divergent ideas may be explored before the convergence into final products. Although, this isn’t to say the linear path option doesn’t allow for wide-net idea generation, as the connection between points of inspiration are more clear. This collection will be designed under the guidance of the linear design process, as this not only better links to the idea of storytelling but also intertextuality, two key themes. <br> <br>
	Storytelling is one of human-kind's defining abilities (Harari, Purcell and Haim-Watzman, 2015) Along with our opposable thumbs, it allowed us to not only reach the top of the food chain but then exit it completely. For a long time we only communicated stories by spoken word, passed down from elders to children for generation after generation, for thousands of years. Then as we evolved we developed primitive scripts, pictorial languages made using symbols from the real world to mark down and record a set idea, concept or thing (Harari, Purcell and Haim-Watzman, 2015). When a story was passed down as an oral tradition, before the advent of writing, it would often change by a degree each time it crossed hands. Slowly over time, moulding into a far-shot of what it used to be. This idea of factual accounts melting as they move through time is not uncommon, nor did our transition to written language supersede this limitation, as written words also change. We change their meaning, their spelling, they fall in and out of vogue. Over time the meaning that may have once been in that ink on parchment could be lost or forever mis-reread. The art of storytelling has been evolving alongside us: With our changing cultures, our advancing technology and our dynamic social conceptions (Brand et al., 2006). Pushed forward by progressive art movements from the renaissance to cubism to pop music (Brands et al., 2006). This ever advancement of storytelling has allowed for different stories to be told: New perspectives, new ideas, and new voices. However, most importantly it enabled these stories to be heard, seen, read, imagined, felt and loved, like never before, through the advanced expression of art. The language of art. <br> <br>
	Our current progression through the infinite timeline of artistic expression advancement places us in the period of postmodernism- and more narrowly -neo-expressionism (Brands et al., 2006). The artistic language used by Jean-Michel Basquiat (Hans Werner Holzwarth, Nairne and Jean-Michel Basquiat, 2018) and is the foundation art style for the collection. The identifying trait of neo-expressionism is objects, recognisable or often the human body, represented in a rough, violent and deeply emotional form, bold colour is among the common elements manipulated. <br> <br>
	Jean-Michel Basquiat, born December 22nd 1960 in New York City, has been hailed as a master artistic storyteller : From the moment his SAMOⒸ graffiti started to litter the buildings of lower manhattan in 1978 to the time of his death by heroin-overdose at age 27 in 1988 (Hans Werner Holzwarth, Nairne and Jean-Michel Basquiat, 2018). The work of Jean-Michel Basquiat speaks as few artists’ do (Hans Werner Holzwarth, Nairne and Jean-Michel Basquiat, 2018). He has tapped into the raw emotions of paint and marks. Each splatted line crossing over another has intense emotion behind it and you can feel that. His paintings are often so layered, overworked and complex they fill you with a sense of megalophobia (fear of overly large objects) and near sensory overload. But sometimes, only when you really look at them. This period of neo-expressionism presents us with work filled with references (Brands et al., 2006). It could be from pop culture, other arts and/or genres, history or any other form of communication, simple or advanced, from the timeline of artistic expression. This heavy use of intertextuality furthers the concept of changing meaning and the shifting perspectives of time, as the symbols used to communicate complex ideas are from a vast spread of time and cultures. As time progresses from now, the meaning distilled into the design of the garments are no longer in control. This uncontrolled freedom for interpretations exists for all art after it has been created, only it is greatly exacerbated in works of the postmodernist era.
