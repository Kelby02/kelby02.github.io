                Jean-Michel Basquiat, born December 22nd 1960 in New York City, has been hailed as a master artistic storyteller: From the moment his SAMOⒸ graffiti started to litter the buildings of lower manhattan where he was living at 18. As a collaborative effort with Al Diaz, SAMOⒸ was a progressive provocative mostly satirical collection of poems, rhetorical questions and slogans, such as, ‘SAMOⒸ IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO GOD’. They garnered a lot of attention. <br> <br>
                However, by 1980, Basquiat and Diaz had fallen out, ending SAMOⒸ and leading to Basquiat inscribing a SoHo building with, ‘SAMOⒸ IS DEAD’. <br> <br>
                It wasn’t long before Basquiat began making a name for himself on his own. By 1981 his art was in shows across the city and even in Moderna, Italy. He only continued to skyrocket in fame and success. Painting at all hours. By the mid-1980’s he was earning 1.4 million US dollars a year (James Tarmey 2019). Unfortunately, this sudden fame and money was very negative on him, with Michael Shnayerson writing, ‘The more money Basquait made, the more paranoid and deeply involved with drugs he became’ (James Tarmey 2019). <br> <br>
                His cocaine use became so excessive he blew a hole in his nasal septum. On August 12th 1988, at the age of 27 Jean-Michel Basquiat died of a heroin overdose (Anthony Haden-Guest 2014). <br> <br>

        The work of Jean-Michel Basquiat speaks to me on the level only few artists do. He has tapped into the raw emotions of paint and marks. Each splatted line crossing over another has intense emotion behind it and you can feel that. His paintings are often so layered, overworked and complex they fill you with a sense of megalophobia (fear of overly large objects) and near sensory overload. But sometimes, only when you really look at them.

                    Staring into the empty eye sockets of the disjointed skeleton (symbolising death) arranged as a trusty steed, appearing almost as if in motion, rything under the bearance of his equally disfigured jockey. ‘Riding with Death’ (1988) was one of Basquiat's last paintings before his own death; one can only assume the jockey is meant to represent him: Riding off with death into the sunset, fighting with death, or standing alongside death as a compatriot? Maybe it isn’t a self portrait at all, but the horrors he saw in the darkness, coming for him.

                    Dazed, crazed and staring off in the distance, ignorant of you. ‘Untitled (Head of Madman)’ (1982), displays an overtly human but disfigured face, with neo-expressionist single line glasses, bold black dashes and swirls for hair: with a neck to long and broad off-kilter uneven shoulders. However, most striking is the shape of his head, seemingly in two pieces at the back and then morphing together behind the eyes. Basquiat finely studied human anatomy and used it boldly in his work, the face and body are great conveyors of emotion, even in art as our minds are hardwired to decode and decipher their meanings. Here I see this distortion of the head silhouette as a direct metaphor on the ‘madman’s shape of mind. Maybe another self portrait?

            The artistic language used by Jean-Michel Basquiat (Hans Werner Holzwarth, Nairne and Jean-Michel Basquiat, 2018) and is the foundation art style for the collection. The identifying trait of neo-expressionism is objects, recognisable or often the human body, represented in a rough, violent and deeply emotional form, bold colour is among the common elements manipulated.

                    ‘Leonardo da Vinci’s Greatest Hits’ (1982) is a collection of figure studies of legs, feet and the full body all on a large 2x2 metre polyptych. Named in reference to the man who produced some of the most recognisable and acclaimed anatomy figures. Sentences like ‘STUDIES OF HUMAN LEG  PLUS THE BONE OF THE LEG IN MAN AND DOGⒸ’ & ‘RETURN OF THE PRODIGAL PRODIGAL’ along with others are scattered through the figures, as satirical names, or possibly even commentary on his fellows in the art world. This single work speaks to the way Basquiat clearly couldn’t let a chance for meaning, commentary, intellectualism and symbolism to pass him by: even a simple figure study couldn’t go without a rugged black man building the railroad through the middle, or medical jargon littering the edges of his anatomical sketches.

                    Stark toughness, grit, determination, anger and furry. ‘Untitled’ (1982) depicts a skull of thick black lines with an open square mouth floating in a sky of blue that is messy with clouds and thoughts. The figure feels overrun, by thoughts, emotions, the chaos of life. You can sense the conflict within, slowly devouring his mind and body.
