        The design process is often very personal, in its material and the practices people undertake, however Fiona Dieffenbacher’s theory of design attempts to incorporate all possible journeys by dividing them into two simple groups. The first group being ‘linear design’, where each idea in the design process is directly inspired from the one preceding it (Dieffenbacher, 2013). A series of steps, one after the other, goal driven and schedule based. Opposingly, ‘random design’ is scattered idea generation from a wider range of sources and inspirations: This more exploratory way of design is driven by intuition more so than logical planning (Dieffenbacher, 2013). A larger amount of divergent ideas may be explored before the convergence into final products. Although, this isn’t to say the linear path option doesn’t allow for wide-net idea generation, as the connection between points of inspiration are more clear. This collection will be designed under the guidance of the linear design process, as this not only better links to the idea of storytelling but also intertextuality, two key themes.
