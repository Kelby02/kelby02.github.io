            <p> Symbolism is a 19th century art movement, beginning as a reaction to the dominant styles/movements of the time of realism and naturalism, seeks to represent complexities of reality through metaphoric language and imagery. As a  natural companion to intertextuality, the use of symbols allows for meaning and connection to be inserted into works for viewers to explore and interpret.

                        <p> Below is a breakdown of one symbolic element used in Look3 (US) as a point of intertextuality, all symbols and embellishments follow similar complex paths from their origins in to the artwork.

                    <p>On the front right frame is boldly stamped “WALLAL DOWNS” & “STARVATION BOAT HARBOUR” in striking contrast, their equally bold unifying line sets a clear divide on the panel. <br><br> This is pictographically symptomatic of Western Australia’s State Barrier Fence, which runs from the south coast at Starvation Boat Harbour to the mid north coast of the state at Wallal Downs. 1800 km of fence rapidly constructed in the early 20th century to stop the spread of rodents, specifically rabbits. The fence was originally called the rabbit proof fence (No.1). <br><br> As such, built upon these two elements is a layer of intertextual referencing to the book, and later movie, “Follow The Rabbit Proof Fence”. A harrowing personal account of three Indigenous girls, victims of the Australian Government in an over half century long authoritative set of policies now referred to as The Stolen Generation, escaping and making their way home guided by the fence. Often studied in Australian Schools as an introduction to the horrors of the nation's pasts, how far we have come, and why it is not yet enough.
                        <br><br><br> The line is simple and non-descript, but with these names and to an informed viewer it is transformed into a fence 1800 km long, known nationally as a symbol of division and national tragedy as influenced by culture and art.
