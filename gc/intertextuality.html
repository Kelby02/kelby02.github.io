        <p> This extract on postmodernism from, ‘The Power of Fashion: About Design and Meaning’, describes many aspects of the postmodernism movement visible in Basquiat’s work, but most extensively and importantly the concept of <b>intertextuality.</b></p>

        <p> ... the term postmodernism as applied to art and culture. A crucial characteristic of postmodernism is the fading distinction between high and low culture. Over the course of the twentieth century the traditional notion of culture has been freed from its connection with elitist art. Scholars nowadays employ a broad notion of culture, based on Raymond William’s famous expression ‘culture as a whole way of life’ (1958). Here it concerns a view of culture as a practice within a social and historical context.</p>

        <p class="lexed"> The rigid distinction between high and low culture is no longer tenable. In any case, it was always largely based on the controversy between word and image in western culture, where the word is seen as the expression of the superiority of the mind and the image as expressing emotion and the baser desires of the body. The shift from a textural to a visual culture means the image is no longer viewed in purely negative terms but is valued for all its positive powers and the experiences it evokes.
            Moreover, ‘high’ culture and ‘low’ culture cannot be unequivocally linked to particular disciplines (read: literature versus television). Every art form has its low culture expression. Just think of portraits of the gypsy boy with a tear running down his face or pulp romantic novels. ‘High’ is stepping off its pedestal: haute couture is influenced by street culture. ‘Low’ is upgraded and receives attention in newspaper art supplements or is exhibited in museums. Advertising photos from Benetton, computer art by Micha Klein and fashion photos by Inez van Lamsweerde have all been shown in Dutch Museums.</p>

            <p> Democratisation and commercialisation are also crucial to the discussion of ‘high’ and ‘low’. Increased prosperity and dissemination via the media have brought art and fashion to within almost everyone’s reach. The enormous numbers of visitors to major exhibitions testify to this, as does the ‘festivalisation’ of big cities. Culture is ‘in’ and is eagerly consumed in large quantities. Moreover, commercialisation is no longer associated exclusively with low culture; is has penetrated high culture, as can be deduced from the weekly top ten lists for literature and the piles of CD’s of music by Bach and Mozart in the local supermarket, Audi’s sponsoring of the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, or Karl Lagerfeld’s designs at H&M.

        <p> Another postmodern feature is intertextuality, which amounts to the idea that a text always refers to other texts. Every text is a web of quotations, borrowed words and references. This term does not, of course, simply represent a narrow view of text; images likewise ceaselessly refer to each other. Advertising spots refer to video clips, which borrow from television series, which in their turn quote films, which are themselves based on a novel. And that novel refers again to a play by Shakespeare, and so on and so on. It’s an endless game. Madonna’s video clip ‘Material Girl’ refers for example to Marylin Monroe’s song "Diamonds are a Girl’s Best Friend” in the film ‘Gentlemen Prefer Blondes’. In an advertisement for Este Lauder perfume, the model walks through a field of flowers that is identical to the one Madonna walks through in her video clip ‘Love Profusion’. Nicole Kidman, in the commercial for Chanel No. 5, does a perfect repeat of her role in ‘Moulin Rouge’. Some directors, such as Baz Luhrman or Quentin Tarantino, have made intertextuality their trademark. A large part of visual pleasure in contemporary culture is based on recognition: the more references you can place, the more clever you feel as a viewer.

            Some theorists, such as Fredric Jameson, call the postmodern form of intertextuality a ‘pastiche’. A pastiche is a textual or visual quotation which merely repeats; shear quoting is the name of the game. The reference has no deeper meaning because all the historical connections are abandoned. This can also be found in fashion. If you look at a John Galliano creation you can recognise myriad quotations: from other cultures (ethnic prints), from other times (Nineteenth century silhouette), from street culture (‘bag lady’ with shopping cart and plastic bags) and even the circus (clown-like make-up). Everything is thrown into a big pile while elements are wrenched from their historical time and geographical context.
            A term often used in this connection is ‘bricolage’, which literally means making do. We’ve become a ‘cut & paste’ culture, where everyone can tinker about and scrabble together their own clothes and even their identity. Postmodern culture is thus characterised by pastiche and bricolage. It’s not always an easy matter to indicate the significance of this cultural phenomenon, but it does make fashion playful and flexible, without being compelled into an overruling ‘Grand Narrative’. A final characteristic of postmodernism that I would like to discuss is the transition from representation to simulation. We have already seen that postmodern pastiche - quoting, borrowing and referring - does not necessarily have any deeper meaning. This is because postmodern culture no longer represents, but simulates. This process is dependent upon the role of media technology.
