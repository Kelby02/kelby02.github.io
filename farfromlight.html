            <p> Task with making a collection inspired by the culture & fashion-masters of Japan, I explored and gathered ideas and concepts from a few places; Japan’s cultural love for death, Jun’ichirō Tanizaki’s explanation of beauty in Japan and Rei Kawakubo’s revolutionary view of clothes and silhouettes.
                <br><br>
                These are the three main influences for my collection, with the elements and principles they share being of most focus. Honorable suicide in Japan has long been an act of grace, tranquility and pain. An act so brutal and violent on the surface, but ethereal and devine below.
                <br><br>
                Kawakubo’s work prominently features many concepts and design features that I wanted to also feature in my designs. Strong shapes, built up layers and volume - with her small element of chaos.

            <p>Tanizaki’s influential book, In Praise of Shadows, explores the beauty of Japan. How Japanese culture has developed to treat nature, imperfections, mystery and harmony as key aspects of beauty. The ways of the Japanese were formed by nature; formed by reality, the reality of the world they lived in. Where beauty did not show itself, it was sought out, for it is hidden in everything.
                <br><br>
                Tanizaki muses on the idea that over time Japanese culture has found or forced beauty into everything, from the simple shine of sweet soy-sauce to the dark eves of temples whose paintings are barely visible. A key point he touches on is harmony, the harmony of people and land; the harmony of sunlight and shadows; the harmony of mystery and beauty.
                <br><br>
                “If light is scarce then light is scarce; we will immerse ourselves in the darkness and there discover its own particular beauty.”
                <br><br>
                “The quality that we call beauty ... must always grow from the realities of life.”
                <br><br>
                “In making for ourselves a place to live, we first spread a parasol to throw a shadow on the earth, and in the pale light of the shadow we put together a house.”
